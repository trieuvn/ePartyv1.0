# eParty - Party Management System

## Overview
eParty is a digital catering and event management system designed to streamline the challenges faced by event and party organizers.

- Manage food orders
- Track inventory
- Allocate staff resources
- Generate detailed reports
# With eParty, managers can create and oversee event orders, including food selections and service personnel, while the system:
- Automatically checks for duplicate bookings
